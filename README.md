# VRMLProjekt
This is a small VRML project for my university's computer graphics course. 
The scene shows a couple of skiers on a snowy hill. The scene is decorated with a cabin, some trees and a magical ski-lift that works without cables.

The buttons trigger both a day and a night mode, in which the skybox is updated and torches held by the skiers.

One of the skiers is animated and, upon pressing on him, follows curved lines down the slope, visits the cabin and returns to the top of the hill with the ski-lift.

There are also a couple of different viewpoints from which to admire the scene.

All in all it was a fun - albeit at times frustrating - experience in order to gain hands-on-experience with...
- Nodes in general and specifically node-based graphic systems
- Generating models
- Scripted Animation and to a certain extent, integrating JavaScript in VRML
- Researching, learning about and implementing older, sometimes poorly documented technologies
